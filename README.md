# ember-basic-dropdown-527-reproduction

Minimal reproduction for cibernox/ember-basic-dropdown#527.

Click on the trigger at the bottem to open the result list. Type an "M" into the search bar.
The dropdown is resized, but the top edge of the dropdown stays put,
which leads to a gap between the bottom of the dropdown and the top of the trigger.
  
Downgrading to ember-basic-dropdown@2.0.11 fixes the issue.
